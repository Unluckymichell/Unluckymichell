### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Overview

I am a German hobby developer and work mostly alone. 
I currently work as an electrician, so I don't have much time to concentrate on programming.
 
I like to take part in small projects free of charge, but only if I don't have a given contract date.
If someone finds a spelling mistake in my code, they are free to send a pull request and, if they wish, I will include them in the list of participants
