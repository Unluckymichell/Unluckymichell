### Hi there 👋

## Overview

I am a German hobby developer and work mostly alone. 
I currently work as an electrician, so I don't have much time to concentrate on programming.
 
I like to take part in small projects free of charge, but only if I don't have a given contract date.
The easiest way to reach me is with discord! Username: Unluckymichell#2970
